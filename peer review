peer review (Vivian Stewart)

1) What did you like about this website?
    I like the colors that you used for the navigation bar and background. They go together very nicely. 
    I also like the organization of each page and the animation on the “the-resort” page. This site is engaging and easy to navigate.
    
2) Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. 
    One significant difference between my P1 and Matt’s P1 is that his pages were better organized and the colors he used drew in the users 
    attention more than the colors I used. 
    
3) Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
	  The code is well-structured in each file and well-organized between files and directories. 
    All CSS files are in a folder named “css” and all images are in a folder named “images”.
    
4) Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
	  The only issue I found was on the “Contact us” page. If the window was readjusted the form did not always stay in its box. 
        a)were semantically appropriate elements selected
            Yes, semantically appropriate elements were selected. All the names for id’s and classes made sense in the context that they were used in.
        b) Is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
            Yes, there was one CSS sheet that had all the shared style elements that was linked to each document. None duplicated elements were put in separate style sheets. 

5) Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
     I really like the website's look and usability. One suggestion would be to change the image on the home page so I can see more of it and 
     it doesn't move around as much when I change the size of the page.
