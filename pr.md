1. What did you like about this website?
The website is charming!  I like the menu you made and the way the pictures are themed with the whole website.  I also like the logo he came up with.

2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's.
    1. Which has a better user experience (and why)?
    I would say his does.  He has more content throughout the pages and its genuinely interesting to navigate.
    2. Which codebase do you think is more maintainable (and why)?
    I would have to say mine.  I have only one css file and I tried to limit special formats on each page.  It seems like there are quite a few extra style rules on this website.

3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
Yes.  Everything is in their appropriate files and the html is remarkably readable.

4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    1. were semantically appropriate elements selected
    Yes.  The elements selected worked and helped me understand the html.

    2. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
    Yes.  His general css style page is located in top-page-css.css.

5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
I would have to say that the naming convention you use for css pages is a little weird.  They already have the file extension, so you don't need to add CSS in the title.  It seems a little redundant.  I would also say that your website needs some texture.  I feel like it, while information packed, is decoratively bland.
